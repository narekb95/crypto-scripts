# Crypto Scripts

**Crypto scripts** is a gathering of some simple and short *google-scripts*
that I write in my free time. Mostly related to *crypto investing*.

Some scripts use third-party APIs, and therefore
require corresponding API keys. Current used APIs
are provided by the following websites:

* [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/api) - Free subscription suffices.
* [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) - No Key required.

To run a script follow the following steps:

1. Create a [google-script](https://script.google.com) project.
2. Copy the script into the project.
3. Set a time-based trigger to run the script periodically.

Comments, bug-fixes and feedback are highly appreciated.
