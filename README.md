# Crypto Scripts

**Crypto scripts** is a gathering of some simple and short *google-scripts*
that I write in my free time. Mostly related to *crypto investing*.

To run a script follow the following steps:

1. Create a [google-script](https://script.google.com) project.
2. Copy the script into the project.
3. Set a time-based trigger to run the script periodically.

Comments, bug-fixes and feedback are highly appreciated.

If you have suggestions or requests send them to my [email](narekb95@gmail.com).
